# data_analyst_vidhya_smart-_search

1. Browse through the free courses on the platform: Explore and collect data (e.g.,
course titles, descriptions, curriculum) from the free courses available on Analytics
Vidhya platform.
2. Develop a smart search system: Build a search tool that quickly finds and suggests
the most relevant courses using keywords and natural language queries.
3. You can use either LangChain 0.3.x or LlamaIndex 0.12.x libraries to build the RAG
system. Make sure to store the generated embeddings in any vector database.
4. Deploy the tool on Huggingface Spaces: Once your search tool is ready, deploy it on
Huggingface Spaces. You can use any framework (such as Gradio, Streamlit, or others)
as long as it is publicly accessible via Huggingface Spaces.
5. Share the link for review: Provide us with the public link to your deployed smart
search tool for evaluation.
6. Share your approach: Share with us a document (e.g. docx, pdf, etc.) that explains
how you have approached the problem, and the methodology behind the embedding
model and LLM selection.
