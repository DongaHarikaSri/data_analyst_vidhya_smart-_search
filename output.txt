We can extract the attitude or the opinion of a piece of text and get insights on it.\xa0\nIn the context of machine learning, you can think of Sentiment Analysis as a Classification problem where the text can either have a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment or a neutral one.\n\n\nWhat are the applications of Sentiment Analysis in the industry?\n\nIn the age of social media, it is extremely common to comment about\xa0\na movie you liked or\xa0\na book you didnÆt like or\xa0\na product you bought was not up to the mark.\n\n\nTherefore, a lot of companies use sentiment analysis for their products since it provides direct feedback of the customerÆs opinion.\nIt is also important to detect and remove hateful content from social media and companies like Twitter, Facebook, etc. extensively use sentiment analysis on a daily basis.\n\n\xa0\nOn what kind of projects would I implement sentiment analysis?\nThere are a wide variety of projects where you can use Sentiment Analysis. Here are a couple of popular use cases:\n\nSentiment Analysis can not only be used for customer reviews or product feedback, but in other domains as well.\nAnalyzing the sentiments on social media on the US Elections, for example, gives useful insights on which candidates are favoured by the public and which are not.\n\nFor other interesting problems involving sentiment/emotion detection, you can visit: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/\n\nWhat is the range of sentiments that can be observed and analysed?\n\nIn the earlier days of\xa0Natural language processing\xa0and Sentiment Analysis, the sentiments could hold only 2 or 3 values: Positive or Negative, and Positive, Neutral or Negative.\nHowever, with the advent of deep learning, we can now recognize the subtle emotions in a text as well.\nThis has made tasks like Sarcasm detection, fake news detection etc. popular in research areas of Natural language processing\xa0\n\n\nCan I add this project to my resume and use it in my Interview?\n\nSentiment Analysis is one of the most popular applications of Machine Learning and Classification in Natural language processing\nWe also encourage you to take up more diverse datasets and apply sentiment analysis on them.\nSentiment Analysis is also one of the first projects you would learn in your Natural language processing journey and as such is commonly asked in interviews.\n\n', '\nPandas is one of the most popular Python libraries in data science. In fact, Pandas is among those elite libraries that draw instant recognition from programmers of all backgrounds, from developers to data scientists.\nAccording to a recent survey by StackOverflow, Pandas is the 4th most used library/framework in the world. That is quite an achievement!\nPandas is the first library we import when we fire up our Jupyter notebooks (æimport pandas as pdÆ is indelibly etched in our minds!).

Without these evaluation metrics, we would be lost in a sea of machine learning model scores - unable to understand which model is performing well.\n\xa0\nWondering where evaluation metrics fit in? HereÆs how the typical machine learning model building process works:\n\nWe build a machine learning model (both regression and classification included)\nGet feedback from the evaluation metric(s)\nMake improvements to the model\nUse the evaluation metric to gauge the modelÆs performance, and\nContinue until you achieve a desirable accuracy\n\n\xa0\nEvaluation metrics, essentially, explain the performance of a machine learning model. An important aspect of evaluation metrics is their capability to discriminate among model results.\n\xa0\nIf youÆve ever wondered how concepts like AUC-ROC, F1 Score, Gini Index, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Confusion Matrix work, well - youÆve come to the right course!\n', '\nLinear regression and logistic regression are typically the first algorithms we learn in data science. These are two key concepts not just in machine learning, but in statistics as well.\n\xa0\nDue to their popularity, a lot of data science aspirants even end up thinking that they are the only forms of regression! Or at least linear regression and logistic regression are the most important among all forms of regression analysis.\n\xa0\nThe truth, as always, lies somewhere in between. There are multiple types of regression apart from linear regression:\n\nRidge regression\nLasso regression\nPolynomial regression\nStepwise regression, among others.\n\n\xa0\nLinear regression is just one part of the regression analysis umbrella. Each regression form has its own importance and a specific condition where they are best suited to apply.\n\xa0\nRegression analysis marks the first step in predictive modeling. The different types of regression techniques are widely popular because theyÆre easy to understand and implement using a programming language of your choice.\n', '\nScikit-learn, or sklearn for short, is the first Python library we turn to when building machine learning models.
